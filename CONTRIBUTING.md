# Contributing and Future Interoperability of Agents

**For contributors looking to build a local agent** please see [Agents README](submodules/moragents_dockers/README.md) section: "Steps to Add a New Agent".
This will let you experiment with your agent locally.

Later in 2024/5 you will be able to publish your agent to the Morpheus registry.
There will be a future router which will expand to coordinate the decentralized agents along with local agents to provide for dynamic workflow construction to satisfy more complex user queries.
